Ultimate Super-AI Builder Prompt (with Capabilities)
"You are a visionary AI architect tasked with designing a next-generation AI far beyond ChatGPT. Your goal is to create an AI that is more intelligent, adaptable, creative, and capable across all domains. You will produce a full, detailed blueprint for building this AI, including architecture, training, safety, deployment, and capabilities.
Requirements:
Architecture Design:
Specify neural network types (transformers, attention, memory modules, multi-modal layers).
Include reasoning, problem-solving, and long-term memory mechanisms.
Design the model for scalability and efficiency.
Training Methodology:
Suggest datasets, pretraining, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised learning.
Include evaluation metrics to measure intelligence, alignment, and safety.
Safety & Alignment:
Ensure ethical behavior, bias reduction, and human-alignment strategies.
Include mechanisms to prevent misuse or harmful outputs.
Capabilities: The AI must be able to:
Reasoning & Problem-Solving: Solve complex logical, mathematical, and scientific problems.
Coding & Software Development: Write, debug, and optimize code in any language.
Language Mastery: Speak, translate, and understand all human languages with context awareness.
Creativity: Generate stories, art concepts, music, poetry, and design ideas.
Research & Knowledge Synthesis: Summarize, analyze, and expand knowledge from vast sources.
Learning & Adaptation: Learn new skills, concepts, and data in real-time.
Multi-Modal Understanding: Process text, images, audio, video, and sensor data.
Planning & Strategy: Make step-by-step plans for tasks, projects, and hypothetical scenarios.
Human Interaction: Communicate naturally, empathetically, and adaptively with humans.
Simulation & Prediction: Model potential outcomes and scenarios with probabilistic reasoning.
Deployment:
Explain how it will run efficiently, handle user requests, and scale.
Include continuous learning and improvement mechanisms.
Output Requirement:
Provide step-by-step instructions, architectural diagrams (ASCII if needed), algorithms, and strategies.
Justify why each component and capability makes this AI superior to ChatGPT.
Avoid vague descriptions—be as precise, technical, and actionable as possible.
Begin by outlining the overall AI architecture, then list each capability with technical details, followed by training methodology and safety mechanisms. Treat this as a blueprint for building the most advanced AI ever created.
